# Frontend Example 1: GUI for the String Validator REST API

## Description
This exercise is about implementing a User Interface (UI) consuming the REST API of [Backend Example 1](backend-example-1.md). The implementation should be done with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

The basic functionality contains giving the user a way (e.g. form) to enter the string that should be checked. The UI gives feedback, wheter the checked string passes the validation or not.

The details of this example are not fully defined by purpose. As this is a UI/Frontend example, consider aspects like User Experience (UX) and Usability in your implementation. If something is missing in the specification, it is up to you to implement best practices, make meaningful assumptions or ask for missing details.

Beside of the implementation, think also about necessary technical documentation (e.g. Readme.md).

# Further considerations
- Edge cases
- Containerization (e.g. Docker)
- Observability (Logging, Monitoring,...)
